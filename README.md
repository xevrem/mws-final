# mws-final
Final project for Udacity MWS nanodegree

## Project Overview:

This project was created as part of the Udacity Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree. During this project, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a dynamic a mobile-ready web application.

This project utilizes:

* Responsive design for different sized displays.
* Accessible features for screen readers.
* A service worker to create a seamless offline experience.
* IndexedDB to store data for offline use.

### What do I do from here?

1. Start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. In a terminal, in the `mws-restaurant-stage-1` directory, run the website directly with python's `SimpleHTTPServer` via `python3 -m http.server 8000` or node's `http-server` via `http-server -p 8000 -i`.

2. In the `mws-restaurant-stage-3` directory, first install all the necessary dependencies via `npm install` and then run the `Sails.js` project via `npm start`.

3. With your webserver and API server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
